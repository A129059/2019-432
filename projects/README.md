# 432 Project Requirements

The schedule for all deliverables related [to Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project1) and to Project 2 can be found in [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

## Project 1 Materials

- **Instructions** Please review the [Instructions for Project 1 here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project1).
- **Demonstration Project** A demonstration Project 1 built by Dr. Love is available for you now...
    - You can [view the HTML result on Dr. Love's RPubs site](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/project1-demo1_2019-432).
    - Be sure to get the [R Markdown file he used to build the HTML result](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1-demo/432_2019_project1_demo_proposal_draft.Rmd) and [the data that the demonstration project describe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/master/projects/project1-demo/cardiac.dat), if you want to reproduce his work.
    - [This version](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/project1-demo1_2019-432) of the demonstration project covers Tasks 1-9 (everything that belongs in your proposal). A later version will add in Tasks 10-11, fleshing out a nearly complete project.
- **Template** An [R Markdown template for you to use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/432_2019_project1_template.Rmd) in building your Project 1 proposal (and eventual project) [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/432_2019_project1_template.Rmd).
    - The [HTML version of the template](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/template-for-2019-432-project1-proposal) can be [viewed on Dr. Love's RPubs site](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/template-for-2019-432-project1-proposal). This covers Tasks 1-9, just as the proposal does.
- **NEW: PROJECT 1 PROPOSAL GRADING RUBRIC**: Dr. Love prepared [a web page which describes how we will grade the proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.md), which should be very helpful to students working on the proposal, as well as give you the idea of the process we use to assess them. If you like, you can also grab [the PDF version of this rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.pdf).
    - There's a lot of helpful stuff in here: please look this over as you're preparing your initial draft. It will save you a lot of time, I expect.

## Project 2 Materials

- An early draft of [Instructions for Project 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project2) is available.
