# Project Instructions for 432 in Fall 2019

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. Always, always, always turn in project work **on time**. This is because Dr. Love schedules his review time so that he can get it all accomplished in a timely manner. If you're late, that creates problems for him.

## Project 1

[Project 1 instructions are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project1). 

- You can work alone, or in a group of 2, on Project 1. You need to specify that to Dr. Love when you submit your proposal in February.
- The Project 1 Proposal involves 9 parts, and is due at 2 PM on 2019-02-15.
- The completed Project 1 Portfolio involves 12 parts (the first 9 are the Proposal) and is due at 2 PM on 2019-03-15.

## Project 2

Details to come, probably in March. 

The Project 2 Proposal will be due at 2 PM on 2019-04-05, and the completed Project 2 will be due at 2 PM on 2019-05-07, although you will give a presentation of your work on a date to be determined between 2019-04-29 and 2019-05-07.
