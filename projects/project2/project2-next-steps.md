## RE: Dr. Love's Initial Reactions to your 432 Project 2 Proposals

Hello -

I have completed my review of the 35 proposals for Project 2. The Google Sheet I've placed at http://bit.ly/432-2019-project2-proposal-reactions contains one row for each of the 35 proposals. 

- You'll have to be logged into Google via CWRU to see the sheet. 
- The proposals are arranged in the order of their presentation times, so Jordan and Harry are first (Group 1), and Du is last (Group 35). 
- My comments are in column B, marked "Dr. Love's Comments" although I have also made some changes to the titles in Column E. 
- Your job is to look at my comments, and respond accordingly, while checking to see that we now agree on a title and your presentation time matches your understanding.

### Ten proposals received a comment of "OK. I approve as is." and they are listed below. 

### For the remaining 25 proposals, you have a task to complete. 

I would like you to submit (to Canvas - where the item is called Project 2 Proposal Revision) at your earliest convenience (and no later than noon on Monday 2019-04-15) a single document that addresses the comments I posed in the Dr. Love's Comments section. I used the abbreviation RQ to stand for Research Question. 

That document should contain the following six elements, numbered 1-6:

1. Your name, group number (from the spreadsheet) and date and time of presentation
2. The title of your project 2 (after whatever editing you and I have done)
3. A revised research question or questions (incorporating any revisions based on my comments) Remember that a research question should be an actual question, and not an explanation of things.
4. A full description of the data source(s) for your project (incorporating any revisions based on my comments)
5. NEW -  A full description of the models you actually plan to fit to answer the research question or questions you have posed (again reacting to my comments) - many of you originally put this sort of information in with your research question or with your data source description. Now, it should be here.
6. A list of any questions you have for me about the project at this time.

You can build the document using any software you like. Just make sure to submit the result to Canvas no later than noon on Monday 2019-04-15, and the sooner the better. I will grade your document as soon as I can on a scale of 0-5 points. You will need to revise until I am satisfied and award you a score of 5/5.

### For these 10 proposals, I am satisfied

You should go ahead and do the project as you've described it. No additional response is required, and you have been credited with 5 points on Canvas for this task. 

Those 10 approved projects belong to:

- Jordan Fiegl and Harry Persaud
- Jacqui Yarman
- Siyi Zhang
- Amy Attaway
- Michael Osterman
- Wei Dai
- Laurie Ann Moennich
- Joseph Hnath
- Sarah Ronis
- Morgan McGrath

Thank you, and let us know if you have any questions.
