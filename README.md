# 432 in Spring 2019

Spring 2019 materials for PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 432 (formerly called EPBI 432)

432 is the second part of a two-semester sequence (PQHS 431-432) taught by Professor Thomas Love in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences. He may be reached at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`.

## When and Where?

- Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 PM to 2:15 PM in Room **E321-323** in the Robbins Building at the School of Medicine.
- Our first session will be on Tuesday **2019-01-22**, as Dr. Love is away the first week of the semester. 
- Classes meet as listed on the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2019/blob/master/calendar.md).

## What Should I do before the First Class?

Welcome back those of you [who took 431 with Dr. Love this past Fall](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018). If you're newly joining us, welcome! To get a jump on things, prior to our first meeting on 2019-01-22, we encourage you to:

1. Complete the necessary software updates described [below](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/README.md#software). 
2. Please read Karl W. Broman and Kara H. Woo's paper "[Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)" published in a special edition of *The American Statistician* dedicated to Data Science in 2018. A PDF version is available on our [References page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/references).
3. Obtain (and read) Jeff Leek's short book "[How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist)" (recommended price $10). We will expect you to have finished the book by mid-February, but there's nothing to stop you from reading it at any time.

## Key Links

### Available Now

- The [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2019/blob/master/calendar.md) serves as the final word for all deadlines and will eventually provide links for all classes and deliverables.

## Software

The course uses R, R Studio and R Markdown, as were used in 431-432. Get your software up to date on a laptop you can bring to class, for best results. We'll hope you have all of this done before the first class, but if you have problems, we can deal with them at that session. You'll need to have all of this accomplished in order to do your first homework assignment.

1. Download R (R 3.5.2 or later) from https://cran.case.edu/.
2. Download R Studio Desktop (open source edition: version 1.1.463 or later is OK) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
3. Install the necessary R [software packages we'll use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/packages.md).

- If you need additional installation instructions, we recommend using [Dr. Love's 431 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software), or [these Stat 545 instructions](https://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html).
- 432 is also supported by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), a terrific learning platform for data science. On 2018-08-30, I sent those of you who took 431 with me this Fall an invitation to join us in that community. Please do.

## Contact Us

Starting 2019-01-22, contact Dr. Love (and the Teaching Assistants) by emailing **431-help at case dot edu**. Yes, even though this is 432, it's easier to just continue to use 431-help.

If you have questions about the course before 2019-01-22, email Dr. Love at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`.
