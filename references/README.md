# References and Resources for 432 - Spring 2019

This page provides a bibliography and links list for useful texts and related resources we will reference this semester. Some of you will read all of this material, and others will only read selected pieces.

Some of these materials are **password-protected**. The password will be revealed in class.

## Assigned Reading

- Thomas E. Love (2019) [Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research: Notes for 432](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/).
    - This material will evolve over the course of the semester some, but we expect to discuss most of what's in there now.
- Jeff Leek [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist).
    - We expect you to have read this little book (< 100 pages) by the end of February. Sooner is better.
    - There is a problematic error in the book, specifically in the section under Publishing entitled "Journal Preprint Policies." The text is cut off at the end of the paragraph. I think the point Dr. Leek is trying to make there is either (1) that you should check with the journal you plan to send the work to about their preprint policies rather than relying solely on [the list provided in the Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy), or (2) that you shouldn't restrict yourself solely to journals that are on that list. 
- Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
    - We expect you've already read the *Explore* section (Chapters 1-8), and the *Wrangle* section (especially Chapters 9-12 and 15) reasonably closely before taking 432. If not, get on that soon. 
    - During 432, we recommend that you read the *Communicate* section (Chapters 26-30) by the end of February.
    - The *Model* section (Chapters 22-25) should also be of some interest, although we won't do much with `modelr` in class. Most of you should skim the *Program* section and rest of the book.
- Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo (2018) [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/references/pdf/Broman_and_Woo_2018_Data_Organization_in_Spreadsheets.pdf), *The American Statistician*, 72:1, 2-10, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) will be discussed starting in Class 1.
- Frank Harrell & others (2019) [Glossary of Statistical Terms](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf) will be discussed starting in Class 2.

## Other Useful References

- [datamethods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/) "is a place where statisticians, epidemiologists, informaticists, machine learning practitioners, and other research methodologists communicate with themselves and with clinical, translational, and health services researchers to discuss issues related to data: research methods, quantitative methods, study design, measurement, statistical analysis, interpretation of data and statistical results, clinical trials, journal articles, statistical graphics, causal inference, medical decision making, and more."
