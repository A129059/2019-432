- Professor Love's Slides will be posted: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class04/432_2019_slides04.pdf), or [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class04/432_2019_slides04.Rmd). 
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Minute Paper Feedback

My comments and aggregated feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 03 are gathered at http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute3-results.

## rstudio::conf 2019 is where I was for the first week of class

- You can [watch many of the sessions in online videos](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019), and 
- the conference slides have been [gathered in a Github repository](https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides).

I enjoyed many sessions, but the [coolest one was by Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/3d-mapping-plotting-and-printing-with-rayshader), talking about [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/).

> rayshader is an open source R package for producing 2D and 3D hillshaded maps of elevation matrices using a combination of raytracing, spherical texture mapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion. It also includes the ability to export 3D models to a 3D print-ready format, and includes a post-processing depth of field effect for 3D visualizations.
