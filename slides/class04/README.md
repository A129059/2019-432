## Minute Paper Feedback

Comments on the Minute Paper after Class 03 are gathered at http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute3-results.

### A Few Links Related to that Feedback

- [R Studio's Cheat Sheets repository](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR](https://happygitwithr.com/)

## rstudio::conf 2019 is where I was for the first week of class

- You can [watch many of the sessions in online videos](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019), and 
- the conference slides have been [gathered in a Github repository](https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides).

I enjoyed many sessions, but the [coolest one was by Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/3d-mapping-plotting-and-printing-with-rayshader), talking about [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/).

> rayshader is an open source R package for producing 2D and 3D hillshaded maps of elevation matrices using a combination of raytracing, spherical texture mapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion. It also includes the ability to export 3D models to a 3D print-ready format, and includes a post-processing depth of field effect for 3D visualizations.
