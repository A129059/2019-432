## SMART BRFSS 2017 data: A New Pull

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(skimr); library(broom); library(janitor)
library(simputation); library(tidyverse)

smart_oh_2017 <- readRDS("data/smart_2017_oh.rds")

smart2_raw <- smart_oh_2017 %>%
    mutate(personcode = as.character(1:nrow(smart_oh_2017))) %>%
    select(personcode, genhealth, alcdays, female,
           bmi, height_m, weight_kg, exerany, 
           seatbelt = seatbelt_always, mmsaname)
```

## Missingness?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(smart2_raw))
```

## Simple Imputation and Re-calculating of BMI

```{r}
set.seed(20190131)

smart2 <- smart2_raw %>%
    impute_cart(seatbelt ~ mmsaname) %>%
    impute_pmm(exerany ~ mmsaname) %>%
    impute_pmm(height_m ~ exerany + female) %>%
    impute_pmm(weight_kg ~ exerany + female) %>%
    impute_cart(genhealth ~ mmsaname + weight_kg) %>%
    impute_pmm(alcdays ~ mmsaname + female) %>%
    mutate(bmi = weight_kg / (height_m^2))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(smart2))
```

## Saving as an R data set

```{r}
saveRDS(smart2, "data/smart2.rds")
```

Now, we could have started with ...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smart2 <- readRDS("data/smart2.rds")
```

and ignored everything except for the package loading.

## Using `mosaic::inspect`

```{r}
mosaic::inspect(smart2)
```

## `mosaic::inspect(smart2)`

## Using `female` to model `bmi`

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = factor(female), y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
```

## Using `alcdays` to model `bmi`

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = alcdays, y = bmi)) +
    geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_bw()
```

## Using `alcdays` to model `bmi`, stratified by `female`

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = alcdays, y = bmi, 
                   color = factor(female))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) + theme_bw()
```

## `alcdays`, `female` and interaction to model `bmi`

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = alcdays, y = bmi, 
                   color = factor(female))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    guides(col = FALSE) + theme_bw() + 
    facet_wrap(~ female, labeller = label_both)
```

## Building Two Models

We'll predict `bmi` using `female` and `alcdays`...

- and their interaction

```{r}
model_2i <- lm(bmi ~ female * alcdays, data = smart2)
```

- without their interaction

```{r}
model_2no <- lm(bmi ~ female + alcdays, data = smart2)
```

## ANOVA comparison for Nested Models

```{r}
anova(model_2i, model_2no) 
```

## Comparing Nested Models via `glance`

```{r}
glance(model_2i) %>% round(., 2) %>% print.data.frame
glance(model_2no) %>% round(., 2) %>% print.data.frame
```

## Predictions with `model_2i`

```{r}
tidy(model_2i) %>% print.data.frame
```

## Interpreting the Interaction Model

With interaction, the model is

`bmi` = 29.26 - 0.27 `female` - 0.06 `alcdays` - 0.07 `female` x `alcdays`

1. What is the predicted `bmi` for a male who used alcohol on 10 of the last 30 days?
2. What is the predicted `bmi` for a female who used alcohol on 10 of the last 30 days?

## Interpreting the Interaction Model

With interaction, the model is

`bmi` = 29.26 - 0.27 `female` - 0.06 `alcdays` - 0.07 `female` x `alcdays`

So, for males, the model is:

`bmi` = 29.26 - 0.06 `alcdays`

And, for females, the model is:

`bmi` = (29.26 - 0.27) + (-0.06 - 0.07) `alcdays`, or 28.99 - 0.13 `alcdays`

Both the slope and the intercept of the `bmi` - `alcdays` model depend on `female`.

## Predictions with the Main Effects Model

```{r}
tidy(model_2no)
```

`bmi` = 29.46 - 0.59 `female` - 0.09 `alcdays`

1. What is the predicted `bmi` for a male who used alcohol on 10 of the last 30 days?
2. What is the predicted `bmi` for a female who used alcohol on 10 of the last 30 days?

## Interpreting the Main Effects Model

Without the interaction, the model is

`bmi` = 29.46 - 0.59 `female` - 0.09 `alcdays`

So, for males, the model is:

`bmi` = 29.46 - 0.59 `female` - 0.09 `alcdays`

And, for females, the model is:

`bmi` = (29.46 - 0.59) - 0.09 `alcdays`, or 28.87 - 0.09 `alcdays`

Only the intercept of the `bmi` - `alcdays` model depends on `female`.

- The change in `bmi` per additional day of alcohol use does not depend on sex.

## What if we had a multi-categorical factor?

Suppose we want to study the impact of both `exerany` and `genhealth` on BMI.

```{r}
smart2 %>% count(genhealth)
```

Does it seem like we need to collapse any levels here?

## Collapsing?

```{r}
smart2 %>% count(genhealth, exerany)
```

**Now** does it seem like we need to collapse any levels here?

## Cross-Tabulation?

```{r}
smart2 %>% tabyl(genhealth, exerany)
```

## Distribution of `bmi` by `genhealth`?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
    theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~ genhealth)
```

## Boxplots with variable widths?

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = genhealth, y = bmi)) +
    geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE) + theme_bw()
```

## Summary Statistics?

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(bmi ~ genhealth, data = smart2)
```

## `bmi` by `genhealth` and `exerany`?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
    theme_bw() + 
    facet_grid(exerany ~ genhealth, labeller = "label_both")
```

## Code for Previous Slide

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
    theme_bw() + 
    facet_grid(exerany ~ genhealth, labeller = "label_both")
```

## Boxplots instead?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = factor(exerany), y = bmi)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(exerany)), 
                 varwidth = TRUE) + 
    theme_bw() + guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ genhealth)
```

## Code for previous plot

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(smart2, aes(x = factor(exerany), y = bmi)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(exerany)), 
                 varwidth = TRUE) + 
    theme_bw() + guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ genhealth)
```

## Can we use `favstats` for two factors at once?

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(bmi ~ genhealth + exerany, 
                 data = smart2)[c("genhealth.exerany", 
                          "mean", "sd", "n", "missing")]
```

## Table of Means and Standard Deviations

```{r}
smart2 %>% group_by(genhealth, exerany) %>%
    summarize(mean.bmi = mean(bmi), sd.bmi = sd(bmi))
```

## Check interaction first with means plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
smart_sum <- smart2 %>%
    group_by(genhealth, exerany) %>%
    summarize(mean.bmi = mean(bmi), sd.bmi = sd(bmi))
ggplot(smart_sum, aes(x = genhealth, y = mean.bmi,
                       col = factor(exerany))) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean.bmi - sd.bmi,
                      ymax = mean.bmi + sd.bmi),
                  width = 0.2, position = pd) +
    geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
    geom_line(aes(group = factor(exerany)), position = pd) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "Any Exercise?") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(y = "Body Mass Index",
         x = "Self-Reported General Health",
         title = "BMI by General Health, Exercise",
         subtitle = "Means +/- Standard Deviations")
```

## Means Plot code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
smart_sum <- smart2 %>%
    group_by(genhealth, exerany) %>%
    summarize(mean.bmi = mean(bmi), sd.bmi = sd(bmi))
ggplot(smart_sum, aes(x = genhealth, y = mean.bmi,
                       col = factor(exerany))) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean.bmi - sd.bmi,
                      ymax = mean.bmi + sd.bmi),
                  width = 0.2, position = pd) +
    geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
    geom_line(aes(group = factor(exerany)), position = pd) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "Any Exercise?") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(y = "Body Mass Index",
         x = "Self-Reported General Health",
         title = "BMI by General Health, Exercise",
         subtitle = "Means +/- Standard Deviations")
```

## ANOVA with and without interaction term

```{r}
model_3no <- lm(bmi ~ genhealth + exerany, data = smart2)
model_3i <- lm(bmi ~ genhealth * exerany, data = smart2)

anova(model_3i)
```

## Does the interaction have a meaningful impact?

- Means plot is essentially parellel: no clear interaction.
- SS(interaction) = 39, SS(Total) = 266241, so $\eta^2$ = .00015 or 0.015%
- *p* value for interaction term is 0.91

What does this imply about which model might be more helpful?

## Making Predictions with `model_3no`

- Anna exercises and is in very good health.
- Brad doesn't exercise and is in poor health.

```{r}
round(coef(model_3no),2)
```

## Making Predictions with `model_3i`

- Anna exercises and is in very good health.
- Brad doesn't exercise and is in poor health.

```{r}
round(coef(model_3i),2)
```

## Predictions

```{r}
newpeople <- tibble(
    name = c("Anna", "Brad"), 
    genhealth = c("2_VeryGood", "5_Poor"), 
    exerany = c(1, 0))

predict(model_3no, newdata = newpeople)

predict(model_3i, newdata = newpeople)
```

## What if we add in `alcdays`?

```{r}
model4 <- lm(bmi ~ alcdays + genhealth * exerany, 
             data = smart2)

anova(model4)
```
