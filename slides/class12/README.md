# 432 Spring 2019 Class 12: 2019-03-07

- Today's class continued with the semi-live coding work on the Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey. More details to come.
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. [Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project1) is due at 2 PM on 2019-03-15.
    - A complete draft of Tasks 1-11 (including analyses) for Project 1 is [here in HTML](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/project1_demo_2019-432), and [here in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1-demo/432_2019_project1_demo_full_draft.Rmd).
    - Last week, I augmented [the Project 1 Instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project1) with some materials on spending degrees of freedom and adding non-linear terms to a model.
2. [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due at 2 PM on 2019-03-22. It **will be AVAILABLE SOON**.
3. Your [Project 2 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects) is due at 2 PM on 2019-03-29. 
    - Those of you without a good idea for a project 2 proposal (and who are perhaps considering using things like existing educational or machine learning repositories with very old data), here are a few recommendations:
        - [County Health Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation)
        - [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)
        - [500 Cities](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/index.htm) data
        - Sports fans might like [the Lahman baseball database](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lahman/versions/6.0-0), [NFL Scrap-R data](https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data/tree/master/games_data/regular_season), [English and European soccer results](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata), [NBA Stat R](https://github.com/abresler/nbastatR), or [Stats on the T tennis data](https://github.com/skoval/deuce),
        - and, there's always [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).
4. I didn't manage to do a Minute Paper this week, for which I apologize. That will return after the break.

## Quiz 1 Results

- Grades for Quiz 1 are posted to [the Homework Roster](http://bit.ly/432-2019-homework-results) at http://bit.ly/432-2019-homework-results. You'll need your homework code, which Dr. Love emailed you on 2019-02-07.
- The [Quiz 1 answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/sketch_quiz_01_2019.pdf) includes detailed grading information, and is [available to you now](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/sketch_quiz_01_2019.pdf).
- The maximum possible grade on the quiz was 60 points. 
- The highest score achieved was 55.5/60. The mean was 46 and the median score was 48.5.
- Over the break, I will extend two honors opportunities. Details to come.

1. Successful completion of the first opportunity will increase your score a bit on the quiz, and will be open to anyone who wants to take advantage of it, and in fact, I hope **everyone** does it. 
2. The second opportunity will include the first but also something more extensive, will come with the potential for a larger increase in your quiz score, but will be restricted to those who scored below 50/60 on the quiz initially.

## A Note on Interpreting Effect Sizes

An obvious issue with the Quiz was that it's difficult to describe an effect size. I built a document to try to help, which we'll review today. It's available [in PDF (as a Tufte Handout)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class12/class12note.pdf), [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class12/class12note.Rmd), and works [with a small data set](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class12/small.csv).
