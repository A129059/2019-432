## Announcements

- Homework regrade requests can be submitted to http://bit.ly/432-2019-regrades at any time before 2 PM on May 7.
- I redid the [Slides for Class 05](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/slides/class05) (2019-02-07) to fix the problems with screenshots. The [revised slides are posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/slides/class05).
- **NEW: PROJECT 1 PROPOSAL GRADING RUBRIC**: Dr. Love prepared [a web page which describes how we will grade the proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.md), which should be very helpful to students working on the proposal, as well as give you the idea of the process we use to assess them. If you like, you can also grab [the PDF version of this rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.pdf).
    - There's a lot of helpful stuff in here: please look this over as you're preparing your initial draft. It will save you a lot of time, I expect.
