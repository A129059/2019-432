# 432 Spring 2019 Class 02: 2019-01-24

- Professor Love's Slides are now available: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class02/432_2019_slides02.pdf), or [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class02/432_2019_slides02.Rmd). 
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due 2019-02-01 at 2 PM.
    - After today's class, you should certainly be able to do Questions 1 and 4, and perhaps the other two, as well.
- [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects) is due 2019-02-15 at 2 PM. It's worth your while to read about that over the weekend. The hardest part is identifying an appropriate data set.

## Today's Materials

- We'll provide feedback in response to the [Minute Paper after Class 01](http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute01).
- We'll also touch on the [Glossary of Statistical Terms](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf) by Frank Harrell & others (2019). 
- We'll be discussing the BRFSS/SMART example, an earlier version of which is introduced in [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/linear-regression-on-a-small-smart-data-set.html).

Specifically, today, we'll be looking at data from the 2017 version of SMART BRFSS. Information on how I compiled the data we'll use in class today (and for a while) can be found in the [smart_2017 folder on our Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/data-and-code/smart_2017). 

## Announcements

1. There are three days in March (2019-03-07, 2019-03-26 and 2019-03-28) when our usual class recorder will be unavailable. Is there anyone else in the room who would be willing to record the class for us on those days? If so, please let us know through 431-help at case dot edu.

2. Minute Paper after Class 1 results and feedback are now posted at **LINK TO COME**.

## Tweet of the Day

Coming soon.

## Visualization of the Day

Coming soon.

## Next Time

We'll be continuing our discussion of linear models in the SMART BRFSS data, continuing with analysis of variance, and then moving into analysis of covariance, and expanding on to more interesting strategies for using linear models in practical work.
