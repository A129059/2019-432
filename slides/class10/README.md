## Using Splines (for discussion today)

Paul C. Lambert has [some great interactive graphs](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/) to explain many interesting ideas in biostatistics. Today, we'll look specifically at his materials on **splines**, which include visualizations describing:

- [the number and location of knots](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_eg/spline_eg)
- [continuity restrictions](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_continuity/spline_continuity)
