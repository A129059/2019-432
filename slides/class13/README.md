## Deliverables

1. The [Minute Paper after Class 13](http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute13) is now available at http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute13, and is due at 2 PM Wednesday 2019-03-20.
2. [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework/homework4) is now available, and is due at 2 PM on Friday, 2019-03-22. You should be able to do all four parts of the Homework now.
3. The [Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity is available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/README.md), and  due at 2 PM Monday 2019-03-25. I hope that everyone takes advantage of this.
4. The [Project 2 Registration Form](http://bit.ly/432-2019-project2-registration) by 9 AM on Monday 2019-04-08. This requires that you (or you and your partner) complete the form at http://bit.ly/432-2019-project2-registration. 
    - I've revised the [Project 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects/project2) quite a bit. Please read them carefully.
5. I've revised the [Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/calendar.md) to reflect changes in the due dates and planned class sessions, including changes to the dates for the Project 2 Registration Form, Homework 5 and Homework 6, as well as a change in the dates for Quiz 2, plus details on when the project presentations will be held, and when you'll know your schedule for that.

## General Announcements

1. I've regraded Question 4 on Quiz 1.
    - The problem was that `bootdif` will give you a (slightly) different answer if you compare A - B vs. B - A using the same seed. Thanks to Siyi Zhang for showing me that this was the case.
    - So I went back through for those of you who gave a confidence interval of (8.85, 12.10) instead of the (8.80, 12.05) I obtained, and gave you an additional two points if that was the problem with your prior response. If you were one of the three people in that situation, you received an email from me telling you this on 2019-03-12, and your Quiz grade is now updated on the roster.
    - The [Quiz 1 answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/sketch_quiz_01_2019.pdf) now reflects this change.
