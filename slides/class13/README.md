## On Preparing Figures

A substantial part of Project 2 revolves around figures/plots/visualizations. With that in mind, there's an engaging twitter discussion motivated by [this post from David Winter](https://twitter.com/TheAtavism/status/1104866769242513408) who is teaching a lesson on preparing figures (visualizations) for first-year graduate students. 

Winter's [original tips](https://twitter.com/TheAtavism/status/1104866769242513408) included:

### A few of the references I generated immediately

- Here's Rafa Irizarry at SimplyStatistics.org on "[Dynamite Plots Must Die](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/)" from 2019-02-21.
- [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833), from PLOS Computational Biology, is certainly a good place to go for general advice, if you'd like to read an article.
- I also admire Gina Reynolds' [ggplot flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1)

### Some Tweets I've Enjoyed or Would Like to Amplify

- from [Alyssa Goldberg](https://twitter.com/WireMonkey/status/1105113772119769088)

- Unsurprisingly, I enjoyed [Jenny Bryan's thoughts](https://twitter.com/jennybryan/status/1104885181570211840) on the subject.

- The sage advice I've always heard on this point [was echoed by Winter](https://twitter.com/TheAtavism/status/1104925150053453824)

: if you ever find yourself saying "not sure if you can see this in the slide...", then you should have made a better slide.

- [Joseph W. Brown](https://twitter.com/j0sephwb/status/1104885917880217601) reminds us of the importance of fun.

- [Dr Jenny Richmond](https://twitter.com/JenRichmondPhD/status/1104979375152222208) reminded me about `geom_quasirandom` and beeswarm plots.

- [Hadley Wickham tweeted out](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/765893450172473344) a nice example of this sort of plot, back in 2016.

- [Ben Wilson](https://twitter.com/N_BenWilson_Z/status/1104896184336826368) chimed in with great advice on pie charts

- [Grumpy Old Health Stats Dude](https://twitter.com/healthstatsdude/status/1105126175557353472) pokes some fun at this in describing the anatomy of a winning TED talk.

## General Announcements

1. I'll also provide an update on where I am with grading Project 1.
2. I've regraded Question 4 on Quiz 1.
    - The problem was that `bootdif` will give you a (slightly) different answer if you compare A - B vs. B - A using the same seed. Thanks to Siyi Zhang for showing me that this was the case.
    - So I went back through for those of you who gave a confidence interval of (8.85, 12.10) instead of the (8.80, 12.05) I obtained, and gave you an additional two points if that was the problem with your prior response. If you were one of the three people in that situation, you received an email from me telling you this on 2019-03-12, and your Quiz grade is now updated on the roster.
    - The [Quiz 1 answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/sketch_quiz_01_2019.pdf) now reflects this change.

## A Few "Internet Things of Potential Interest"

1. Hadley Wickham speaking on "Coding Data Science" and Data Science Challenges at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies in March 2019: [video on YouTube](https://t.co/kndx3PVMaQ).
2. Laurie Ann Moennich sent along [Jasmine Weber's post "How W.E.B. Du Bois Meticulously Visualized 20th-Century Black America"](https://hyperallergic.com/476334/how-w-e-b-du-bois-meticulously-visualized-20th-century-black-america/)


## A Generic Example: Developing A Rubric for Describing an Effect Size

Please see [the Generic Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/data-and-code/generic_example) on our [Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/data-and-code). 
- This example will provide a longer-term in-class discussion activity over the next few sessions. Today, I'll introduce the ideas involved, and we'll play around with them a little bit.
- The `generic.csv` data set I used to craft the example (based on real data from part of the SUPPORT / right heart catheterization study) is [also provided](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/data-and-code/generic_example/data/generic.csv).
