## General Announcements

1. I've regraded Question 4 on Quiz 1.
    - The problem was that `bootdif` will give you a (slightly) different answer if you compare A - B vs. B - A using the same seed. Thanks to Siyi Zhang for showing me that this was the case.
    - So I went back through for those of you who gave a confidence interval of (8.85, 12.10) instead of the (8.80, 12.05) I obtained, and gave you an additional two points if that was the problem with your prior response. If you were one of the three people in that situation, you received an email from me telling you this on 2019-03-12, and your Quiz grade is now updated on the roster.
    - The [Quiz 1 answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/sketch_quiz_01_2019.pdf) now reflects this change.
