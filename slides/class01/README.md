## Deliverables



## Today's Materials

- Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo (2018) [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/references/pdf/Broman_and_Woo_2018_Data_Organization_in_Spreadsheets.pdf), *The American Statistician*, 72:1, 2-10, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) will be discussed starting in Class 1.
- The material we discuss today about building a Table 1 in R is introduced in [Chapter 1 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/building-table-1.html).

I've included a few files related to Chapter 1 of the Course Notes above, which (I hope) will let me code live.
