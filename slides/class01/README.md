# 432 Spring 2019 Class 01: 2019-01-22

- Professor Love's Slides for Class 1 are available for download as class begins. Most people will want to [download the pdf file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/432_2019_slides01.pdf), but the [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/432_2019_slides01.Rmd) I used to generate the PDF is also available.
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Getting Help

For any questions related to the course, email `431-help at case dot edu`. Our teaching assistants and myself are now monitoring this, and this should yield the fastest possible response.

- TAs this term: Bob Winkelman, Satyakam Mishra, Maher Kazimi, Zuxi (Terry) Cui, and Xueyi (Julia) Zhang.
- Office hours are 11:30 - 12:45 Monday through Friday, plus 2:30 - 3:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Details at the bottom of the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

## Deliverables

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due 2019-02-01 at 2 PM.
- There will be a minute paper after today's class. Please visit **LINK TO COME** to complete it by 2 PM tomorrow (2019-01-23).

## Today's Materials

- Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo (2018) [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/references/pdf/Broman_and_Woo_2018_Data_Organization_in_Spreadsheets.pdf), *The American Statistician*, 72:1, 2-10, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) will be discussed starting in Class 1.
- The material we discuss today about building a Table 1 in R is introduced in [Chapter 1 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/building-table-1.html).

### We'll do some "live" coding today. Materials for that include: 

- [bradley_table1.md](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/bradley_table1.md) = Github Markdown result of applying my code
- [bradley_table1.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/bradley_table1.Rmd) = R Markdown code
- [bradley.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/data/bradley.csv) data file, which the code expects to be in a `data` subfolder.

There is also a pair of files showing how I simulated the `bradley.csv` data in R: [bradley_sim.md](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/bradley_sim.md) and [bradley_sim.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class01/bradley_sim.Rmd), if you are curious.

## Supplemental Materials discussed today

### On Data Organization

- The [Leek group guide to data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing): "How to share data with a statistician"
- Shannon Ellis and Jeff Leek "[How to share data for collaboration](https://peerj.com/preprints/3139/)" preprint.
- Hadley Wickham's paper on [Tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) from *J of Statistical Software*
- Jenny Bryan "[Naming Things](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)" presentation on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files).

- CRAN vignette providing an overview of functions in [the `janitor` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) including `clean_names`.
- We saw several cartoons from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/).

### Building Table 1

- Today's Table 1 example came from Bradley SM, Borgerding JA and Wood GB et al. [Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcome Associated with In-Hospital Acute Myocardial Infarction](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2720923), published 2019-01-18 in *JAMA Network Open* doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.73
- [Instructions for Table Creation](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/ifora-forms/jama/tablecreationinst.pdf) from JAMA
