## Today's Plan

**To come**.

## Some R Packages for ROC Curves

On 2019-03-01, Joseph Rickert at Rviews had a [nearly-comprehensive post on R Packages for displaying ROC curves](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/03/01/some-r-packages-for-roc-curves/) which was very informative for me.

## Video of the Day

Here's a [video we'll watch today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=s3JldKoA0zw). 

- I was motivated to show you this by David Keyes (@dgkeyes) [who had a nice set of posts](https://twitter.com/dgkeyes/status/1101554699566641152) about the benefits of R Markdown, to which Jenny Bryan responded by linking to the [1 minute 44 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=s3JldKoA0zw).
- There's a [nice repository](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/from_raw_data_to_paper_and_presentation) by Gina Reynolds (EvaMaeRey) showing [examples of implementing a reproducible workflow using R Markdown](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/from_raw_data_to_paper_and_presentation) from raw data to a research paper, slides, and a poster.
- From that same thread, comes a link to [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) which looks like a nice tool for generating PDF posters of your research using R Markdown.

## Visualization / Github Web Site of the Day 

Check out [Cinematic Names](https://maryzam.github.io/movie-names/?utm_source=digg&utm_medium=email) by [Mary Zam](https://twitter.com/MaryZamCode). 

> How I processed character names from about four hundred thousand films & TV series, shot from 1960 to our days, and found out the difference between naming in real life and cinema world.
