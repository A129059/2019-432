## Project Proposal Status

As of 10 AM Monday, we have reviewed 15 of the 35 proposals (there are four teams of two), and responded to them on Canvas.

- Some of those people have completed the proposal acceptably.
- Some people need to make minor revisions, and have received an email from me specifying an earlier deadline for their revision.
- Some people need to make more major revisisions, and have received an email from me specifying a later deadline for their revision.

The remaining 20 proposals will be reviewed before Class 08, and you will know which of those three categories above you're in before class begins.

## Announcements

- What are we going to do on Thursday of this week?
- When is our next Minute Paper?
- When will we hear back about our Project 1 Proposals?

## Why You Don't Just Throw Away Outliers...

Yes, outliers make your regression estimates problematic, but ... be careful...

The video [here (about 1 minute in)](https://indiana.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.antarctica/a-hole-in-the-sky/) may give you pause. Ignore outliers at your peril!
