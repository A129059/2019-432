## Project Proposal Status

We've reviewed all 35 proposals (there are four teams of two, and 39 students), some multiple times, and responded to them on Canvas.

- Out of the 39 students in the class, 18 have an accepted proposal now. Those are the ones with scores of 10 on Canvas.
- The remaining folks (with a score below 10) need to complete a revision, due at **2 PM Wednesday 2019-02-20**. 
    - Resubmit (the entire proposal, including .Rmd, .HTML and .csv) to Canvas. 
    - When you have successfully completed your proposal, your score will become 10, and prior scores are then ignored.
- Dr. Love will respond to the revisions on Wednesday afternoon and evening, via Canvas. If you still score below 10 at that time, your next revision will be due at *6 PM on Thursday 2019-02-21*.
- To use spell-check in R Studio, hit F7.

## Why You Don't Just Throw Away Outliers...

Yes, outliers make your regression estimates problematic, but ... be careful...

The video [here (about 1 minute in)](https://indiana.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.antarctica/a-hole-in-the-sky/) may give you pause. Ignore outliers at your peril!
