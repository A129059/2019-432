# 432 Spring 2019 Class 17: 2019-04-02

- Professor Love's Slides are posted above: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class17/432_2019_slides17.pdf), and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class17/432_2019_slides17.Rmd). 
    - Today's slides discuss regression models for ordinal categorical outcomes. This is also discussed in [Chapter 19 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/modeling-an-ordinal-categorical-outcome-in-ohio-smart.html)
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. [Project 2 Registration and Scheduling Form](http://bit.ly/432-2019-project2-registration) due at **9 AM** on Monday 2019-04-08.
2. [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework/homework5) due at 2 PM on Friday 2019-04-12. Submit via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

## Grades

1. [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework/homework4) grades will be posted soon.
2. [Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/README.md) grades will be posted for the revision as soon as possible to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - If you scored 4 or higher, your grade for this has already been entered into Canvas, and you'll receive the extra points on your Quiz 1 score.

## Questions I intend to answer very soon

1. How can we make predictions effectively after multiple imputation?
2. Can we estimate odds ratios (and confidence intervals for those CIs) using `lrm` for a one-unit change in a quantitative predictor, along with the default (25th percentile, 75th percentile) comparison?
3. What happens when we use a linear regression model on a binary outcome - the so-called *linear probability model* - how does the compare to logistic regression and probit regression?
4. In building an imputation, when should we include knots as part of fit.mult.impute?
5. What were some of the most appealing or interesting visualizations people came up with this year in Homework 4?
6. How do we build the maps shown in our Class 15 README? 

I also intend to fix a typo that Joseph and Julia indpendently found in Section 15.11.1 of the Course Notes "here(lrm)" should be "here(ols)". But I have to do that from home.

## Next Journal Club Session is Thursday April 4

The journal club meets on Thursday 2019-04-04 (Wood WG82-C at 2:30 PM) to discuss [Moving to a World Beyond p < 0.05](https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913?needAccess=true)

- We'll discuss some related materials in Classes 22 and 23.
- Roger Peng and Hilary Parker discuss the significance of statistical significance in their [2019-03-28 Not So Standard Deviations podcast](http://nssdeviations.com/77-back-to-statistics).

## More to come.
