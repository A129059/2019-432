## From my email on Tuesday

- I've finished grading the first attempts at the [Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/README.md) for all students. 
    - The results may be found at http://bit.ly/432-2019-homework-results. 
    - Please also read the updated comments on those attempts I've provided on the [Class 15 README page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class15/README.md). 
    - If you scored 3 or lower, you need to revise your work (please feel free to discuss this with the TAs in person or at 431-help) and resubmit the entire thing, with all necessary corrections to the [newly opened space for revisions of this work on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). 
    - If you scored 4 or higher, your grade for this has already been entered into Canvas, and you'll receive the extra points on your Quiz 1 score.

## Need help with writing / grammar / syntax?

## Free Workshop on Bayesian Causal Inference at Ohio State June 2-4

The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) is hosting a workshop on Bayesian Causal Inference from June 2-4, 2019 in Columbus, OH.  The workshopâ€™s goals are to promote the use of Bayesian methodology in causal reasoning, to present the latest theory and application developments of Bayesian framework/model in causal inference, and to discuss current and future research directions.  

This workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (via grant funding to the MBI), National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), and Columbus Chapter of the American Statistical Association.  Tutorials will be offered by Fan Li, Peter Muller and Steven MacEachern on June 2, and invited talks will be presented by distinguished researchers on June 3-4.
