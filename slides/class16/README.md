## From my email on Tuesday

- I've finished grading the first attempts at the [Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/README.md) for all students. 
    - The results may be found at http://bit.ly/432-2019-homework-results. 
    - Please also read the updated comments on those attempts I've provided on the [Class 15 README page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class15/README.md). 
    - If you scored 3 or lower, you need to revise your work (please feel free to discuss this with the TAs in person or at 431-help) and resubmit the entire thing, with all necessary corrections to the [newly opened space for revisions of this work on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). 
    - If you scored 4 or higher, your grade for this has already been entered into Canvas, and you'll receive the extra points on your Quiz 1 score.

## Need help with writing / grammar / syntax?

- I encourage you to check out [CWRU's Writing Resource Center](https://writingcenter.case.edu/). They also offer online consulting.
