## From my email on Tuesday

- I've finished grading the first attempts at the [Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/README.md) for all students. 
    - The results may be found at http://bit.ly/432-2019-homework-results. 
    - Please also read the updated comments on those attempts I've provided on the [Class 15 README page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class15/README.md). 
    - If you scored 3 or lower, you need to revise your work (please feel free to discuss this with the TAs in person or at 431-help) and resubmit the entire thing, with all necessary corrections to the [newly opened space for revisions of this work on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). 
    - If you scored 4 or higher, your grade for this has already been entered into Canvas, and you'll receive the extra points on your Quiz 1 score.

## Need help with an issue in the Honors Opportunity?

- In addition to 431-help and the TA office hours, might I suggest a review of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/)? The search function is especially helpful. 

## Need help with writing / grammar / syntax?

- I encourage you to check out [CWRU's Writing Resource Center](https://writingcenter.case.edu/). They also offer online consulting.

## Homework 4 grades will be available on 2019-03-29.

- Some of the nice [visualizations from the 2018 version of Homework 4 are gathered here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class16/2018_nice_viz.pdf). 

## Here's another nice thread of student-built visualizations

From Alex Engler's [class in data visualization](https://twitter.com/AlexCEngler/status/1101245224733605891) at the University of Chicago.

## Next Journal Club Session April 4

We will be continuing the book club in the form of a journal club on Thursday 2019-04-04 (Wood WG82-C at 2:30 PM) - and we will be discussing [Moving to a World Beyond p < 0.05](https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913?needAccess=true)

- This is fantastic.
- We'll discuss some related materials in Classes 22 and 23.
- Roger Peng and Hilary Parker discuss the significance of statistical significance in their [2019-03-28 Not So Standard Deviations podcast](http://nssdeviations.com/77-back-to-statistics).

## Minute Paper Feedback is available at http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute15-results

## Questions I intend to answer very soon (see [README 17](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/edit/master/slides/class17/README.md) for progress)

1. How can we make predictions effectively after multiple imputation?
2. Can we estimate odds ratios (and confidence intervals for those CIs) using `lrm` for a one-unit change in a quantitative predictor, along with the default (25th percentile, 75th percentile) comparison?
3. What happens when we use a linear regression model on a binary outcome - the so-called *linear probability model* - how does the compare to logistic regression and probit regression?
4. In building an imputation, when should we include knots as part of fit.mult.impute?
5. What were some of the most appealing or interesting visualizations people came up with this year in Homework 4?
6. How do we build the maps shown in our Class 15 README? 

On 2019-03-29, I fixed a typo that Joseph and Julia independently found in Section 15.11.1 of the Course Notes "here(lrm)" should be "here(ols)". But I have to do that from home.

## Free Workshop on Bayesian Causal Inference at Ohio State June 2-4

The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) is hosting a workshop on Bayesian Causal Inference from June 2-4, 2019 in Columbus, OH.  The workshopâ€™s goals are to promote the use of Bayesian methodology in causal reasoning, to present the latest theory and application developments of Bayesian framework/model in causal inference, and to discuss current and future research directions.  

This workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (via grant funding to the MBI), National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), and Columbus Chapter of the American Statistical Association.  Tutorials will be offered by Fan Li, Peter Muller and Steven MacEachern on June 2, and invited talks will be presented by distinguished researchers on June 3-4.  

Registration is free, and is now open at the workshop website https://mbi.osu.edu/event/?id=1253 until May 10th.  We are also accepting poster abstract submissions through the registration.  There will be up to 10 travel awards for graduate students and postdocs who are accepted to present posters at the workshop.  To apply for the travel award, please complete the registration with the requested documents (CV and poster title/abstract) by April 15th.
