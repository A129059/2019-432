## Project Grading and Feedback

1. Your grade on Project 1 was posted to Canvas last night. 
    - It's on a scale from 0-100, where 70-84 is a B, and 86-100 is an A, with 85 the cutpoint between an A and a B. 
    - All projects met the standard for B work, at least, so congratulations!
    - Every project had a mix of things I was happy about and things I wasn't so happy about.
2. The available feedback I have for you is to be found in the Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/432-2019-project1-evaluation.
    - In class, I will discuss (briefly) each of the elements (columns) in that sheet. The rows are our usual homework code, for those of you who worked alone. For those who worked in a group, I've specified your team code to you in an email sent last night.
    - A few comments occurred with enough frequency for me to develop an indexed set of those comments, and you'll find those on the second tab of the Google Sheet.
    - No, I won't give you a formula to determine your overall grade based on those elements, because I graded the work holistically, as well as element-by-element. These project 1 grades are final. 
    - If you have questions about how to do something more effectively that was highlighted as a problem in my feedback, please bring those questions to office hours, or send them along to 431-help.
    - Several common themes emerged, and I will address them in future work this semester. 
        - In some cases (effect specifications, and counting degrees of freedom), I already have.
    - I'll also remind you that the Project 2 instructions are different than the instructions/requirements for Project 1. Do not redo Project 1 in Project 2: that will not work.

## Mapping: A Tease

- I expect that many of you are going to want to learn how to generate something like this, but maybe not.

- Or, perhaps you'd be interested in building [a more interactive map, like this](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/data_center/report_22/maps/report22_overweight_obesity_map.asp). A screenshot follows...

Please respond to the [Minute Paper after Class 15](http://bit.ly/432-2019-minute15) so that I can gauge interest.
