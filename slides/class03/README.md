- Professor Love's Slides are now available: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class03/432_2019_slides03.pdf), or [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class03/432_2019_slides03.Rmd). 
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- There is a **Minute Paper** due tomorrow at 2 PM. **LINK TO COME**
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due this Friday (2019-02-01) at 2 PM.
    - After today's class, you should certainly be able to do all four questions.
    - [Homework 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due the following Friday 2019-02-08, also at 2 PM.

    - The hardest part is identifying an appropriate data set. Any questions at this point?
 
## Where are we in the Course Notes?

- The Course Notes Chapters on [Analysis of Variance](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/analysis-of-variance.html) and [Analysis of Covariance](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/analysis-of-covariance.html) are definitely worth your time now. There, I discuss several things that won't make it into the slides today or Thursday.
- Last time, we worked with the [SMART BRFSS 2017](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/data-and-code/smart_2017) data, and that's coming again for the next few classes.
