# 432 Spring 2019 Class 03: 2019-01-29

- Professor Love's Slides are now available: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class03/432_2019_slides03.pdf), or [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class03/432_2019_slides03.Rmd). 
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- There is a **Minute Paper** due tomorrow at 2 PM. **LINK TO COME**
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due this Friday (2019-02-01) at 2 PM.
    - After today's class, you should certainly be able to do all four questions.
    - **Note**: In the initially posted `hbp330.csv` data file for HW1 (also HWs 2 and 3), a patient was listed with a negative value of `hsgrad` and another with 0. We have corrected those `hsgrad` (and also `income`) values. The corrected `hbp330.csv` data set appeared on 2019-01-25, and has no negative or zero values. Get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/master/data-and-code/hbp330.csv), or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/master/homework/homework1/data/hbp330.csv), or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/master/homework/homework2/data/hbp330.csv), or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/master/homework/homework3/data/hbp330.csv). None of the changes should change your response to any HW 1 questions, but get and use the corrected data anyway.
    - [Homework 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework) is due the following Friday 2019-02-08, also at 2 PM.
- [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/projects) is due 2019-02-15 at 2 PM. 
    - The hardest part is identifying an appropriate data set. Any questions at this point?
 
## Where are we in the Course Notes?

- The Course Notes Chapters on [Analysis of Variance](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/analysis-of-variance.html) and [Analysis of Covariance](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/analysis-of-covariance.html) are definitely worth your time now. There, I discuss several things that won't make it into the slides.
- Last time, we worked with the [SMART BRFSS 2017](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/data-and-code/smart_2017) data, and that's coming again for the next few classes.
