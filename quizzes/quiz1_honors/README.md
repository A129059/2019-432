# Quiz 1 Honors Opportunity

The instructions are [available to you now in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/quiz01_honors_opportunity_2019.pdf). The deadline for submission (via Canvas) is 2 PM on Monday 2019-03-25.

The data set (`honors.csv`) is available, [both above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/honors.csv), and also [on our Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/data-and-code/honors.csv).

Notes:

- In Question 3, "you may spend only a single additional degree of freedom". That eliminates some possibilities, right?
- In fitting your versions of `m1` and `m1a`, you should be obtaining my results. To do this, use no imputation in Questions 1-3, but do not pre-filter to complete cases only. I have tried to clarify this in [the PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_honors/quiz01_honors_opportunity_2019.pdf).
