# Information on Quizzes for 432 in Spring 2019

Quizzes in 432 work like the Quizzes in 431, and are completed using a Google Form to be provided by Dr. Love. Most questions involve multiple-choice responses, short answers or writing code in R.

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. Always, always, always turn in quiz work **on time**. This is because Dr. Love aims to grade all quizzes so that you'll have the answer sketch and your results at the Tuesday class following the Monday quiz deadline.

## Quiz 1

Quiz 1 will be made available to you by noon on 2019-03-01. Your deadline to complete the Quiz is **7 AM on 2019-03-05**. It will cover material discussed in January and February in the course.

### Quiz 1 General Comments

- There are 25 questions. Each question is worth between 2 and 5 points, with partial credit awarded on some questions (so don't leave anything blank.) The maximum score is 60 points.
- You are not permitted to discuss the Quiz with anyone other than Dr. Love and the teaching assistants. 
- If you have questions, we will be happy to answer them, if you submit them via email to `431-help at case dot edu` before 7 PM on Monday 2019-03-04. We will not guarantee a response after that time. 
- If you need to set a seed to respond to a question (and you will), use `set.seed(2019)` every time.
- Remember that the Google Form will close and the Quiz is due at **7 AM on Tuesday 2019-03-05**.

### Quiz 1: Links to Materials
  
- The Google Form to submit your responses will be found at http://bit.ly/432-2019-quiz1-form. All of your responses must be submitted using that Form.
    - Unlike the quizzes in 431, this Google Form is essentially an answer sheet. The actual questions and available response choices (for multiple-choice items) are posted here. (**LINK TO COME**)
- Packages you'll be likely to use in R include the following. (Other packages may be useful, but are not required.)
    - `car`, `leaps`, `modelr`, `rms`, `simputation`, `broom`, `janitor`, and the `tidyverse`.
- The data sets you'll need include (**LINKS TO COME**) the following. You'll need to load in each of the four data sets.
    - `childfev.csv`, `data24.Rds`, `dbptrial.csv`, and `riff1.csv`
- You'll also need to source in the [bootdif.R](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz1_materials/bootdif.R) script.

## Quiz 2 

Quiz 2 will be made available to you by noon on 2019-04-19. Your deadline to complete the Quiz is 2 PM On 2019-04-22. It will cover material discussed throughout the semester, especially in March and April (up through 2019-04-18).

### Grading

Dr. Love grades all questions on all Quizzes. Quizzes 1 and 2 are equally weighted in determining your Quiz grade. The Answer Sketch provided for each Quiz will describe how partial credit was assigned, where available. Apparent errors made in grading your Quiz should be brought to Dr. Love's attention via email.
