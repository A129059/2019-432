# Information on Quizzes for 432 in Spring 2019

Quizzes in 432 work like the Quizzes in 431, and are completed using a Google Form to be provided by Dr. Love. Most questions involve multiple-choice responses, short answers or writing code in R.

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. Always, always, always turn in quiz work **on time**. This is because Dr. Love aims to grade all quizzes so that you'll have the answer sketch and your results at the Tuesday afternoon class immediately following the deadline.

## Quiz 1

Quiz 1 will be made available to you by noon on 2019-03-01. Your deadline to complete the Quiz is **7 AM on 2019-03-05**. It will cover material discussed in January and February in the course.

### Quiz 1: General Comments

- There are 25 questions. Each question is worth between 2 and 5 points, with partial credit awarded on some questions (so don't leave anything blank.) The maximum score is 60 points.
- At the end of the Google Form, you'll have to affirm that you obeyed the rules. You'll need to do this before you can submit your work. If you want to save what you're doing, submit the Form, and then you will be able to return and edit your work later.
- You are not permitted to discuss the Quiz with anyone other than Dr. Love and the teaching assistants. 
- If you have questions, we will be happy to answer them, if you submit them via email to `431-help at case dot edu` before 7 PM on Monday 2019-03-04. We will not guarantee a response after that time. 
- If you need to set a seed to respond to a question (and you will), use `set.seed(2019)` every time.
- Remember that the Google Form will close and the Quiz is due at **7 AM on Tuesday 2019-03-05**.

## Quiz 2 

Quiz 2 will be made available to you by noon on 2019-04-19. Your deadline to complete the Quiz is 2 PM on 2019-04-22. It will cover material discussed throughout the semester, especially in March and April (up through 2019-04-18).

### Grading

Dr. Love grades all questions on all Quizzes. Quizzes 1 and 2 are equally weighted in determining your Quiz grade. The Answer Sketch provided for each Quiz will describe how partial credit was assigned, where available. Apparent errors made in grading your Quiz should be brought to Dr. Love's attention via email.
