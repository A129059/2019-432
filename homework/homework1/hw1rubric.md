General
=======

-   Subtract a point or two in the grade for each question, for each typographical or grammatical error you catch, or for not writing responses in complete sentences, up to a maximum of 25% of the available points for that question.
-   If the student gets the work in after 2 PM on 2019-02-01, mark the time when they submitted the results in the General Problems section, and score them with 10 points in the Penalties column if they get the work in by 3 PM, and 25 points in the Penalties column if they get it in later than that.
-   If they submit the Rmd but not the HTML or vice versa, please note that in the General section, and remind the student via their preferred email to get the completed work in. If they succeed in getting in the full assignment by 24 hours after you remind them, score them with 5 points in the Penalties column from the entire assignment. Otherwise, score them with 15 points in Penalties.
-   Penalties are cumulative, so late incomplete work could cost as much as 40 points (25 for late initial submission, and 15 more for not fixing the problem when you point it out.)

Question 1 (25 points)
======================

-   Award up to 15 points for successfully creating a table one stratified appropriately
-   Award up to 10 additional points for giving a conclusion comparing both groups (including all the variables)
-   A completely successful effort will thus receive the full 25 points, and I expect that to be the modal grade.
-   A reasonable but not completely successful attempt should usually receive 15-21 points, total. Provide comments to all students who score below 23/25.

Question 2. (10 points)
=======================

-   Award up to 3 points for developing an correct plot or plots (labeled correctly) showing the sbp, bpmed and practice.
-   Award up to 4 additional points for developing two models (one with interaction and one without interaction)
-   Award up to 3 additional points for an appropriate conclusion comparing variation and significance in both models (the interaction is either significant, or accounts for a large fraction of the variation in the SBP values)
-   A completely successful effort will thus receive the full 10 points, and I expect that to be the modal grade.
-   A reasonable but unsuccessful attempt should usually receive 6-8 points, total. Provide comments to all students who score below 9/10.

Question 3 (10 points)
======================

-   4 points for developing the new model using the model without interaction.
-   3 points for plotting residuals vs. fitted values and influential points and providing an explanation of the graph.
-   3 points for an appropriate conclusion comparing both models.
-   Does it change the nature of the conclusions you can draw from the model? (the adjustment for `age` does not change the fundamental conclusions from the no-interaction model. Specifically, we continue to see a significant effect of both `practice` (with B showing lower SBPs) and `bpmed` (with those not prescribed such a medication having smaller SBPs.)
-   Again, a completely successful attempt will thus receive 10 points. A reasonable but unsuccessful attempt should usually receive 6-8 points, total. Provide comments to all students who score below 9/10.

Question 4. (5 points)
======================

-   5 points for providing GitHub name, please place it in the HW1 roster.
-   If no name is provided, 0 points.
